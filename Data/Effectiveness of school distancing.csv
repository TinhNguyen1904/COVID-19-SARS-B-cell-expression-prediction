This baseline scenario is provided only for comparison, in order to evaluate the impact of interventions, most of which are already in place in Australia. To re-iterate, we consider timely intervention scenarios applicable to the situation in Australia at the end of March 2020, in which the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases crossed 2,000 on 24 March 2020, and the growth rate of cumulative incidence C˙ stayed above 20% for nearly two weeks prior to that. We observe that the simulated baseline generates the 20% cumulative incidence increase, in a strong agreement with actual dynamics.; In short, the only tangible benefit of school closures, coupled with case isolation and home quarantine, is in delaying the epidemic peak by four weeks, at the expense of a slight increase in the contribution of children to the incidence peak. Given other societal costs of school closures (e.g., drawing their parents employed in healthcare and other critical infrastructure away from work), this strategy may be less effective",Countries: Australia ;Timeline: 49 days,05/28/2020
