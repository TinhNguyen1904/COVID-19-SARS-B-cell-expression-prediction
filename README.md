# COVID-19-SARS-B-cell-expression-prediction & Analysis of the Covid-19 pandemic

#The thesis consists of 5 tasks with the following objectives:
# COVID-19-SARS-B-cell-expression-prediction
#A. Task 1: Predict SARS with B-cell data
Classify peptides into two classes of inducible (positive) and non-inducible (negative) antibodies on the B-cell data set. Predicting antibody valences can be helpful for an antibiotic generation.
#B. Task 2: Predicting Covid-19 with B-cell and SARS data
The peptides were classified into two classes inducible (positive) and non-inducible (negative) antibodies on the combination of two B-cell and SARS-CoV data sets. Predicting whether antibody chemistries will help in antibiotic development.
# Analysis of the Covid-19 pandemic
#C. Task 3: What is known about the transmission, incubation, and stability of Covid-19 to the environment
Find the formula to calculate the time of transmission, transmission rate, recovery rate, and mortality rate in the world. Show the spread on a global map and show the age of infection and related factors. Measures to prevent and minimize the damage caused by Covid-19.
#D. Task 4: Number of cases, total deaths, and pandemic development in countries around the world
Solve for the country with the highest number of deaths, confirmed and recovered, and create a distribution table of cases and symptoms of Covid-19. Interpret the correlation between time since the first case and recovery and predict the number of deaths over time in the world.
#E. Task 5: Create a research table related to Covid-19 and statistics of questions related to the patient
Create a table of articles about Covid-19 research and advances in diagnosis and questionnaires about the incubation period, the time of the spread of Covid-19, the incubation period, and the spread of the disease. transmission, the natural history of Covid-19 as well as the proportion of asymptomatic and symptomatic patients, etc.
